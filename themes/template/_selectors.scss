// _selectors.scss

// Since people use different class names for similar things,
// you can override the defaults with your own CSS selectors.
// Your output CSS will use your selectors.
// Use commas to separate selectors, as you would in CSS,
// and wrap the whole list in quotes.
// E.g. $epigraph: '.epigraph-page .epigraph, .opener .ep';
